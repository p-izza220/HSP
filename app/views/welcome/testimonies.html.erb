			'Shakeema Hutcherson works with my dog Agnes. I cannot tell you how much Agnes loves Shakeema. Their bond is undeniable. When Agnes and I run into Shakeema at the dog run or when I am walking her, she forgets entirely about me, and everything is about Shakeema. That tells me so much about their relationship and about Shakeema herself. When a dog loves someone that much, you know that this person treats that dog gently and tenderly, and that is how I know Shakeema treats Agnes. That's not to say that Shakeema doesn't keep a firm hand on her while on walks, because I know she does. It is Shakeema's careful balance of tenderness and strength that have fostered the enormous trust that Agnes and I both have in her. Shakeema has built a bond with my dog that shows true love, and with me that shows true admiration. I cannot imagine anyone else taking care of the most important soul in my world.'

			<p class="shrink1">'I was extremely nervous to get a dog walker in New York because I have a skittish dog. I noted several dog walkers in my local dog park before I approached Shakeema about working with her. I am so glad I did. She is engaged, aware and completely decidated to the dogs she works with. Everyone in our dog park calls her the dog whisperer because she is so good with them. I have a very shy dog but Shakeema took the time to establish a relationship built on trust with him. I've seen him transform from hiding when it's time for a walk to now where he waits for her by the door. I wouldn't want anyone else working with my dog.'</p>

	    <p class="shrink">'Shakeema has been a part of our family since our very first dog was just 8 weeks old. We now are a zoo of 3 and wouldn't nearly work as well or be as happy on a weekly basis without Shakeema's help. She is professional, reliable, kind, and truly cares about the wellbeing of each of our animals.  Anyone would be lucky to have her help!' </p>
